### Backend Development

### Let's understand two major components
1) A programming Language (eg -: Js,Java,C++)
<br />
2) A Database (eg -: Mongo,Postgres,MySQL)

### What is Backend ?
#### The backend refers to the server-side of an application where data is processed and managed. It involves communicating with a database, handling API requests, and implementing logic that manipulates or retrieves data. The backend ensures the proper functioning of the application's business logic and data storage.

### JavaScript based backend -: 
### Handling -: file,data,third party (APIs)


### Some essential file/folder structure

## Src -: 
(files) <br />
package.json, .env, (Readme,git,lint,prettier etc)
#### Index.js, App, Constant

#### (directories) -: 
(DB, Models,Controllers, Routes,Middlewares, Utils, More (Depends) )


### The three main components of backend

1) <strong>Server</strong> -: This is the computer or system that listens for requests from users (through the frontend) and responds. It runs the backend logic and coordinates the whole process of handling data.

<br />

2) <strong>Database</strong> -: This is where the data is stored. The backend interacts with the database to save, update, retrieve, or delete data.

3) <strong>API</strong> -: The API is like a bridge between the frontend and backend. It defines how different parts of the system communicate and exchange data. When the frontend needs information, it sends a request to the backend via the API.
